# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for omafile. The spec is [omafile-plan.md](omafile-plan.md) — read it first;
this file records what is actually built, what was decided along the way, and what still
needs checking.

## Commands

```bash
./bin/build                        # qmake6 && make -> build/omafile
./bin/test                         # all suites + the §12 startup budget
./build/omafile [path]             # run; defaults to $PWD
./build/omafile --select <file>    # open the parent, preselect the file
./build/omafile --dump-theme       # print the resolved palette, headless (key<TAB>value)

OMAFILE_TRACE_STARTUP=quit ./build/omafile   # print ms to first paint and exit
./build/tests/tst_omafile <testName>         # run one test across all suites
```

**Debugging QML at runtime:** `console.log` is swallowed and Qt routes messages to
journald here. Use `console.warn` plus `QT_ASSUME_STDERR_HAS_CONSOLE=1`, or read
`journalctl --user | grep omafile`.

## Layout

```
src/main.cpp          entry point, CLI, --dump-theme, startup tracing
src/location.*        the value type every path flows through, local and remote
src/entry.h           one directory entry (POD)
src/lister.*          worker-thread directory walk + lazy stat pass
src/watcher.*         coalesced inotify on the current directory
src/directorymodel.*  the model the UI talks to: sort, filter, selection, diffing
src/formatting.*      human sizes and relative times (pure, testable)
src/trash.*           the XDG trash spec
src/fileops.*         copy/move/delete/mkdir/rename on the ops thread
src/journal.*         bounded undo history
src/operations.*      the QML-facing front for ops, clipboard, journal, conflicts
src/clipboard.*       system clipboard in the formats other file managers read
src/opener.*          xdg-open and new windows
src/theme.*           Omarchy theme parsing + hot reload
src/qml/Main.qml      the window
src/qml/EntryRow.qml  one row: name, drag source, inline rename
src/qml/Overlay.qml   the single modal surface
src/qml/Shortcuts.qml the keyboard map, single source of truth (§5)
tests/                one binary, one suite per class, registered in tests/main.cpp
```

## Progress

### M0 — Skeleton ✅
Repo per §2, qmake6 with `qtquickcompiler`, `Theme`, themed window, startup budget in
`bin/test`.

### M1 — Browse ✅
`Lister`, `Watcher`, `DirectoryModel`, `Location`, breadcrumb, status bar, keyboard
navigation, type-to-filter with match highlighting, Enter/xdg-open, hidden files, sorting,
`--select`.

### M2 — Act ✅
Multi-select, copy/cut/paste (Super and Ctrl), drag and drop both directions, XDG trash,
undo, new folder, inline rename, terminal-here, copy path, conflict resolution, progress
line. **91 tests pass.**

**Measured against §12:**

| Budget | Target | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Cold start to first paint | < 120 ms | **112 ms** median (7 runs) |
| 10k-entry directory, complete | < 150 ms | **7 ms** |
| Keystroke → filtered list | < 5 ms | **0 ms** |
| RSS, idle, one window | < 90 MB | **131 MB** ✗ — see below |

## Decisions

### Theme (M0)

**Quattro theme format — resolves open decision §16.1.** Quattro (v4.0.0.alpha) deleted the
per-app theme files; a theme is now `colors.toml` + `shell.lock.toml` + a few app files.
The current-theme path also moved: Quattro reads `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/`,
Omarchy 3.x used `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/`. `Theme` checks both, Quattro first.

**`Theme` is a line-by-line port of omarchy's `bin/omarchy-theme-color`,** the shared
resolver every themed app goes through. Verified byte-identical across all 22 Quattro
themes and the legacy 3.x ANSI format. If it changes upstream, re-run the sweep and re-port.

**Hot reload watches the theme directory's *parent*,** because `omarchy-theme-set` does
`rm -rf current/theme && mv current/next-theme current/theme`, destroying any watch on the
directory itself.

### Browse (M1)

**`opendir`/`readdir`, not `QDirIterator`.** Qt's iterator stats entries to satisfy its
filters, and skipping that *is* the §12 listing budget. It is also why filenames with
newlines and quotes work: nothing shells out, so there is nothing to quote.

**Two passes: names now, stats later.** Listing does zero stat calls; size and mtime are
filled in only for visible rows plus a 24-row buffer.

**Batches land in one go rather than streaming.** Measurement says streaming is not needed
yet — 10k entries complete in 7 ms. Revisit north of ~500k.

**The watcher diffs; it never resets.** A re-list is merge-walked against the current rows
and applied as single-row inserts and removes, so scroll position survives and the
selection follows the *file*, not the row number.

**The watch is established before the listing starts,** closing the window where a file
created during the initial listing would be missed by inotify forever.

**Backspace edits the filter before it navigates up — a deviation from §5,** which assigns
it to "parent directory" unconditionally. With bare letters typing into the filter,
correcting a typo would otherwise throw you into the parent.

### Act (M2)

**Trash is implemented directly against the XDG spec, not delegated to `gio`.** The point
is two-way interop: Nautilus and gio can restore what omafile trashed, and vice versa.
Confirmed live — trashing from `/tmp` correctly used the volume trash
`/tmp/.Trash-$uid` with a **mount-relative** `Path=`, which is what makes the trash still
work if the volume is mounted elsewhere next time.

**The `.trashinfo` file is the lock.** It is created with `O_EXCL`, and whoever wins that
race owns the name. Reserving the name any other way races with a second file manager.

**Conflicts block the worker on a condition variable.** §8 wants Replace / Skip / Rename /
Apply-to-all and explicitly rejects per-file interrogation. Pre-scanning cannot see
conflicts that appear mid-operation, so the worker parks and the GUI answers. `cancel()`
also wakes it, or a cancelled operation would hang forever holding the ops thread.

**Copying a symlink uses `readlink`, not `QFileInfo::symLinkTarget`.** Qt resolves the
target to an absolute path, which silently rewrites a relative link to point back at the
*source* tree — so every internal link in a copied directory would still refer to the
original. Caught by a test, not by reading.

**Undo trashes copies rather than deleting them.** Undo must never be the destructive
operation. Permanent delete is not journalled at all, which is exactly what the confirm
overlay promises.

**Selection is tracked by name, not row index,** so it survives a watcher diff, a filter
change and a re-sort. `actionPaths()` returns the explicit selection, or the current row
when nothing is selected — every verb goes through it, so "no selection" never means
"do nothing to everything".

**The clipboard writes both `text/uri-list` and `x-special/gnome-copied-files`.** uri-list
is universal but cannot express cut versus copy; the GNOME format can, and Nautilus,
Thunar and Dolphin all read it. That is what makes Super+X into another file manager work.
A cut is consumed by its paste, so it cannot fire twice.

**An item that has just become visible cannot take active focus in the same event-loop
turn.** The overlay looked focused (`selectAll()` renders a selection without focus) while
every keystroke went to the window behind it. Focus is now taken via `Qt.callLater`, and
the overlay's `FocusScope` sets `focus: visible` so it becomes the window's focused child.
This cost real time; treat any "the field is up but typing does nothing" symptom as this.

**Two theme-robustness computations, same root cause.** Several themes resolve
`lighter_background` and `selection` straight back to `background`. So the modal panel
colour and the selected-row tint are both computed rather than taken literally, and the
rename field's selection colour is deliberately *not* the row tint — on the row being
renamed those are the same colour, which made an active edit field look like ordinary text.

**Window close is blocked while an operation runs** (§8's "dead simple wins"), rather than
detaching the operation.

## To verify

**RSS is 131 MB against a 90 MB budget — the one §12 miss.** Most of it is not ours:
`Pss_Anon` (the app's own dirty memory) is **27 MB**; ~45 MB is Mesa gallium + LLVM code
pages, file-backed and shared with every other GL client. Decide whether §12's number
should be restated as private memory — in which case we are comfortably inside — or
whether it really means RSS, which may be unreachable for any Qt Quick app on this stack.
Don't optimize until that is settled.

**Drag and drop is implemented but not verified against real apps.** §7 is explicit that it
must be tested against a GTK app, an Electron app and a Chromium tab, and calls that a
release-checklist item rather than a test. None of that has been done. The drag-out side
uses `Drag.Automatic` with `text/uri-list` + `text/plain`; the drop side handles
`hasUrls`, Ctrl/Shift modifiers and 300 ms spring-loading. All of it is currently
**unproven outside omafile itself**.

**Cross-filesystem copy (the `EXDEV` path) has no test.** It needs a second filesystem to
exercise; the same-filesystem `rename(2)` path is covered and verified by inode.

**The conflict overlay has never been seen.** Its logic is tested headlessly (skip,
replace, rename, apply-to-all) but the panel itself has not been rendered once.

**`hyprctl dispatch sendshortcut` is unreliable — roughly one dispatch in three lands.**
It cost most of an afternoon chasing phantom bugs: several "broken" features were verified
working once the dispatch actually arrived, and F2 and Ctrl+1 never arrive at all. Do not
trust it as evidence that something is broken; confirm with logging before believing it.

**Startup headroom is thinning:** 112 ms against 120 ms, up from 104 ms in M1.

**§16.3 is still open.** `Space` toggles selection (launcher-like) rather than extending
it. The plan says try both for a week.

**Quattro paths are only tested against synthetic fixtures** — this machine runs 3.8.3.

**Operation summaries could read better.** "Copied 3 to demo" is terse and does not name
the files when there is only one.

**No bulk rename yet** (§9's vimv approach) — that is M5, along with the `Ctrl+?` overlay
that will be generated from `Shortcuts.qml`'s table.

**Sort bindings are not in the plan's §5 table.** Either add `Ctrl+1/2/3` to it or pick
different keys.

## Conventions

- C++17, Qt 6, qmake6. No CMake.
- Comments explain *why*, and appear where behavior is non-obvious or mirrors an external
  contract. Don't narrate the code.
- Shell scripts in `bin/` follow Omarchy's style: `#!/bin/bash`, two-space indent,
  `[[ ]]` for strings, `(( ))` for numbers.
- Tests run headless under `QCoreApplication` and use a fake `$HOME`/`$XDG_DATA_HOME` or a
  `QTemporaryDir`. The trash tests in particular **must** keep the fake HOME — without it
  they move files into the developer's real trash.
- The GUI thread does not touch the filesystem. Documented exceptions: `Theme` (one small
  read before first paint) and `QFileSystemWatcher::addPath`, which is why the `Watcher`
  lives on the worker thread.
- Two worker threads, per §3: one for listing/watching (owned by `DirectoryModel`), one for
  file operations (owned by `Operations`).
